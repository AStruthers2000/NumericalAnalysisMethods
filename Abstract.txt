The stock market is frequently targeted by mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike. Most people's goal in life is to make a bunch of money, and the stock market provides that glimmer of hope a lot of us need. In this project, I will be attempting to model then S&P 500, one of the most famous indexes on the stock market. The S&P 500 is a portfolio of the top 500 performing companies on the publicly traded market, tied into one index. I will be taking a sample of the price of the S&P 500 once every hour, each hour, for the duration of an arbitrary day, then attempt to fit various interpolating curves to this data in an attempt to predict the next hour's price. The mathematical methods I will use will form different interpolating polynomials that I can then take and plug back in an arbitrary time value. The value of the interpolating polynomials at this arbitrary time value will represent the estimated price of the S&P 500 based off of the previously captured data. From there, I will be able to write code that automatically buys and sells shares of the index and uses these predictions to maximize the value of my trades.
